For this project, I will analyze a bio medical data set about patients having abnormalities in their lower back. A patient is considered abnormal if they have either a disk hernia or Spondylolisthesis. The data set consists of seven features which are, pelvic incidence, pelvic tilt, lumbar angle, sacral slope, pelvic radius and grade of spondylolisthesis. The aim of this project will be to see which of these features are the most important for predicting abnormalities in the spine. Since the features are all interval variables such as degree or length, the data points have been centered by subtracting the mean of the corresponding feature.
```{r}
#Load data and process
vertebral.data <- read.csv("vertebral.csv")
norm.or.abnorm = rep(0, 310)
norm.or.abnorm[vertebral.data$class == "Abnormal"] = 1 
vertebral <- data.frame(pelvic.incidence = vertebral.data$pelvic_incidence - mean(vertebral.data$pelvic_incidence),
                        pelvic.tilt = vertebral.data$pelvic_tilt - mean(vertebral.data$pelvic_tilt),
                        lumbar.angle = vertebral.data$lumbar_lordosis_angle - mean(vertebral.data$lumbar_lordosis_angle),
                        sacral.slope = vertebral.data$sacral_slope - mean(vertebral.data$sacral_slope),
                        pelvic.radius = vertebral.data$pelvic_radius - mean(vertebral.data$pelvic_radius),
                        spondylolisthesis.degree = vertebral.data$degree_spondylolisthesis - mean(vertebral.data$degree_spondylolisthesis),
                        class = norm.or.abnorm)

plot(vertebral[1:6])

#Fitting linear models to select right features
vertebral.fit.glm <- glm(class ~ pelvic.incidence + pelvic.tilt + lumbar.angle + sacral.slope + pelvic.radius + spondylolisthesis.degree, data = vertebral, family = binomial)
summary(vertebral.fit.glm)

```
From the graph above, we can see that some features are highly correlated with one another. This intuitively makes sense, as the lower back is interconnected and works in a mechanical way. 

Since our response variable binary, we will be fitting a logistic regression. The first model will include all the features so we can ascertain the significant ones. From our summary, we see that pelvic tilt, pelvic incidence, lumbar angle, and pelvic radius are all not significant. In fact, pelvic tilt and sacral slope have the exact same coefficients, standard error, and p-value. While pelvic incidence also has the exact same but the negative.

The strange output can be explained by figure 1. It turns out, pelvic incidence is just the sum of the pelvic tilt and sacral slope. So essentially, we are measuring the same value twice making it redundant. Therefore, we will update our model by dropping pelvic incidence and lumbar angle.
```{r}
#Dropping pelvic incidence and lumbar angle
vertebral.fit.glm3 <- glm(class ~ pelvic.tilt + sacral.slope + pelvic.radius + spondylolisthesis.degree, data = vertebral, family = binomial)
summary(vertebral.fit.glm3)
```
As we can see, dropping these features make all the others significant. Also, to note that the parameters for pelvic tilt and sacral slope are not identical anymore.
```{r}
#Interaction Terms
vertebral.fit.glm4 <- glm(class ~ pelvic.tilt + sacral.slope + pelvic.radius + spondylolisthesis.degree + pelvic.tilt*sacral.slope, data = vertebral, family = binomial)

vertebral.fit.glm5 <- glm(class ~ pelvic.tilt + sacral.slope + pelvic.radius + spondylolisthesis.degree + pelvic.tilt*pelvic.radius, data = vertebral, family = binomial)

vertebral.fit.glm6 <- glm(class ~ pelvic.tilt + sacral.slope + pelvic.radius + spondylolisthesis.degree + pelvic.tilt*spondylolisthesis.degree, data = vertebral, family = binomial)

vertebral.fit.glm7 <- glm(class ~ pelvic.tilt + sacral.slope + pelvic.radius + spondylolisthesis.degree + sacral.slope*pelvic.radius, data = vertebral, family = binomial)

vertebral.fit.glm8 <- glm(class ~ pelvic.tilt + sacral.slope + pelvic.radius + spondylolisthesis.degree + sacral.slope*spondylolisthesis.degree, data = vertebral, family = binomial)

vertebral.fit.glm9 <- glm(class ~ pelvic.tilt + sacral.slope + pelvic.radius + spondylolisthesis.degree + pelvic.radius*spondylolisthesis.degree, data = vertebral, family = binomial)

#Matrix of AIC interaction terms
row.names <- c("pelvic.tilt", "sacral.slope", "pelvic.radius", "spondylolisthesis.degree")
column.names <- c("pelvic.tilt", "sacral.slope", "pelvic.radius", "spondylolisthesis.degree")
mat <- c(0, AIC(vertebral.fit.glm4), AIC(vertebral.fit.glm5), AIC(vertebral.fit.glm6), 
        AIC(vertebral.fit.glm4), 0 , AIC(vertebral.fit.glm7), AIC(vertebral.fit.glm8),
        AIC(vertebral.fit.glm5), AIC(vertebral.fit.glm7), 0, AIC(vertebral.fit.glm9),
        AIC(vertebral.fit.glm6), AIC(vertebral.fit.glm8), AIC(vertebral.fit.glm9), 0)

named_matrix <- matrix(mat, nrow=4, byrow=TRUE, dimnames=list(row.names, column.names))
named_matrix
```
However, as mentioned earlier, the lower back works in a mechanical way and therefore interaction terms may be present. When we try different combinations of features, nearly all interactions increase the AIC apart from two, which is highlighted in the AIC matrix. This is just a matrix of AIC scores. The biggest decrease in AIC happens with the inclusion of sacral slope interacting with the degree of spondylolisthesis.

Bio mechanically this interaction makes sense. The LHS of figure 2 depicts spondylolisthesis. Essentially, spondylolisthesis happens when one of your lower vertebral slips out of place as shown by the yellow circle. The red lines in the RHS of figure 2 shows the sacral slope. We can see that as the sacral slope angle increases, the lower vertebral will move towards a more vertical position. Therefore, the probability of gravity pulling forward one of the disks increases and thereby getting spondylolisthesis. 

```{r}
#Summary of Final model
summary(vertebral.fit.glm8)
```
When we look at the summary output of this model, the interaction between sacral slope and degree of spondylolisthesis is significant. Therefore, this will be our final model.

By taking the inverse logit of the intercept we get 0.95 probability of being abnormal, which is a rather high probability. However, this could be due to the underlying data having uneven balances of normal and abnormal cases, as 2/3rd of the dataset is abnormal.

When we try to interpret the coefficient by taking the exp(coefficients), it will show the increase or decrease in odds of being abnormal. This means that the positive coefficients increase log odds by their respective exp(B_i) while the negative will have a decrease in odds.

Increase in pelvic tilt will increase odds of abnormality by exp (0.0717), which means the probability of a disk to slip forward goes up as shown in figure 3. 
An increase in pelvic radius will decrease abnormality. While increases in the degree of spondylolisthesis will increase probability of abnormalities, because it is a direct measure of slippage as shown previously. 

All in all, increases in pelvic tilt and the curvature of the lower spine is likely to cause more abnormality. Thus, we should all strive to have proper posture to avoid lower back injuries.
